I just switched to @Allstate after 10 years with GEICO for auto insurance - HUGE MISTAKE - terrible service from their offshore call center.
Anyone else bothered that @allstate had manpower to film commercial in wreckage but I can't get an adjuster to my house #fail
I HEART Randy Lewis of @Allstate catastrophic claims unit who found me an adjuster so house can close and we can move to WA as scheduled!
@allstate - You have zero professionality and no tact. I hope you pull your &quot;teddy bear commercial&quot; - it was highly offensive!
@Allstate Mayhem RT Why use a hedge trimmer when you can use a chainsaw?
Ugh @Allstate has THE hardest password requirements of any online bill-pay site I use. I end up just resetting my password each time. :(
@Allstate Thanks.  Just want to get to new house.  Remain hopeful while feeling so bad for all the others with horrible storm losses.
Truly sorry 4 those who lost lives &amp; homes but if  @Allstate adjuster doesn't check storm roof in the next week house sale will fall thru.
@AllState just lost a potential customer: too long of hold time w/o music #BadBusiness
@cherylcasone @Allstate Who gives a flying crap what an insurance agent wants?
does anyone else find it to be in poor taste that @allstate is showing tornado devastation to sell their insurance right now?
@Allstate I Dont Want Spam u But Please Don't Ignore Me. I Just Wanna Say u Great &amp; I Love ur Job. Please Follow Me It Would Make My Day
@Allstate no particular commercial is my favorite...I'm just a fan
Tried to go back to @Progressive after @Geico pulled a bait-and-switch on me but Flo decided to QUADRUPLE my old policy. Now with @Allstate
Kind of frustrated with @Allstate - surely I'm not the only person in the world who wants a multi policy discount in 2 diff states...right?
